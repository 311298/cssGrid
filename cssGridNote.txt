css grid notes

diplay : grid -> tells to make it grid like for flexbox

grid-template-coumns and rows tell the container how much rows and columns are need to be made

row-gap and column gap -> tells the gap between the cells

note: extra red space is due to more width is given to container

rather than individually assigning the grid cell space by pxs; we can use the repeat() for grid-template-column and grid-template-rows

1fr -> one width of entire fraction

grid-column-start and end -> line start to line end

when we applying any css of grid on cell it will move the other grid cell

grid-template-rows: 133px 1fr 1fr; -> when we declare the one of them with absolute number then it will given after that other will be given eqivalent spaces

grid-column: 1 /span 3; -> another way of writing the grid column start and end

justify-item: start end centre -> will allign it according to value given horizontally

justify-item works on grid container while justify-self works on grid cell/items

100vw -> 100 percent of width screen
100vh -> 100 percent of height screen

for veritcal align we use the align-item : centre end start
and slign-self for grid items/cells

place-self is used to set both horizontally and veritcally alignment
